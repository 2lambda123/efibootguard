# The following items will be implemented #


* Tools modification
	* Make `bg_setenv -c` and the underlying confirm mechanism to backup
	  the current working environment to the (latest-1) environment, so
	  that if the current environment breaks, there is a backup with the
	  latest values.

* API refactoring
	* Function / Datatype / Variable names remind of Parted and should be
	  renamed if code developes independent of libparted.
